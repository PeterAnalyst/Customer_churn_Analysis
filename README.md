#📊 Customer Churn Analysis with Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn (the loss of clients or subscribers) is one of the most critical challenges businesses face. This project analyzes a telecom dataset to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, I built data visualizations and applied machine learning techniques to predict churn behavior.

The goal is not only to predict customer churn but also to generate actionable insights that can help businesses retain valuable customers.

#🔑 Key Features

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  * Visualized churn by contract type, tenure, and payment methods.
  * Correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships.
  * Segmentation of customers by tenure and contract type.

* Feature Engineering:
  * Created tenure bins for segmentation.
  * Encoded categorical variables.
  * Handled missing values and scaled numeric features.

* Machine Learning Models:
  * Logistic Regression for churn prediction.
  * Feature importance analysis using Decision Trees.
  * Evaluation with Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

* Data Visualizations:
 * Churn rate comparison across categories (contract type, internet service, etc.).
 * Distribution plots and bar charts to highlight churn trends.
